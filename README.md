# TUTOR FINDER BOT
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/r1kV0w-BCXU
#### Description: Matches tutors with students or their parents.
This Telebot is built using Telegram, PyTelegramBotAPI (https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI), Python, and SQLITE3.
MY FIRST CODE EVER! Made it in around 6 hours over 2 days for my CS50 final project. And since we are in lockdown, this shall be my Lockdown Project!
Telegram Bot: https://t.me/TutorFinder_Bot - try it!
Telegram Channel link is kept private for now for testing.
******
**HOW TO USE**:
Type /hello to access the bot. Then follow the questions and instructions accordingly.
Only Phone and Tablet usage are supported, as there's an issue with the new web.telegram.org displaying keyboard buttons and t.me links. 
If you're a tutor, you can only sign up once. Support will be added soon for editing your answers.

There is still a lot of room for improvement, but I'm working on it!
