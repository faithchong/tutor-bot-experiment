# TUTOR FINDER BOT
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/r1kV0w-BCXU
#### Description: Matches tutors with students or their parents.
This Telebot is built using Telegram, PyTelegramBotAPI (https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI), Python, and SQLITE3.
Made it in around 6 hours for my CS50 final project.
******
**HOW TO USE**:
Type /hello to access the bot. Then follow the questions and instructions accordingly.
Only Phone and Tablet usage are supported, as there's an issue with the new web.telegram.org displaying keyboard buttons and t.me links.

There is still a lot of room for improvement, but I'm working on it!
